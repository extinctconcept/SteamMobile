## Steam Mobile App

--

### Objectives and purpose

The purpose of this app is really just as a personal project to occupy my time. 
I want to make a mobile app that utilizes the Steam API by valve because I'm a bit disappointed in
the quality of Valves steam mobile app. 

This app will primarily be for browsing game statistics, reading reviews, watching trailers etc...
I would also like to add features allowing the user to favorite games and browse current sales and so on.

Maybe in the future I'll work on some kind of plugin that will sync app data to steam profiles if possible
But that is not something that I'll currently be working on.

### What this app wont do

This app will not handle any payments or user accounts as that is not provided by the API.
It will not let you login to your profile and purchase games.
